# Content list for the KIT block seminar 
A List of Tools and Tutorials used for the seminar

## Wallet & Client
Oliver used the parity UI v1.10.1-20180413 beta and the parity client v1.10.1-beta-45c29a2-20180413/x86_64-linux-gnu/rustc1.25.0 

Other usefull Environment such as Truffle and Truffel's Ganach can be found in the [README](https://github.com/eorituz/SmartContractDev-Cookbook)


## Smart Contracts
The demonstrated Token Smart contract is inspired by [this](https://www.ethereum.org/token) ERC20 template.
To learn about Solidity it's teaks and general syntax I highly recommend doing all lessons of [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/)

## DApp
The DApp example is taken from Parity s [tutorial](https://wiki.parity.io/Tutorial-Part-1.html).
To deploy, test and play with your DApp use one of ethereums [Testchains](https://wiki.parity.io/Chain-specification.html) (e.g. Kovan) instead of the Parity Dev-Chain!
Basic Javascript DApp can easily be developed within the Parity Client. I recommend [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) for more advanced development
