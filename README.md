# SmartContractDev-Cookbook
A smart contract development cookbook "for runaways". Mostly ordered links and descriptions.

## Patterns for Smart Contract Development

* [Dappsys: Safe, simple, and flexible Ethereum contract building blocks](https://github.com/dapphub/dappsys)
    * has solutions for common problems in Ethereum/Solidity, eg.
        * [Whitelisting](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nexusdev/dapp-a-day-11-whitelist-boring)
        * [Upgradable ERC20-Token](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nikolai/dapp-a-day-6-upgradeable-tokens)
        * [ERC20-Token-Vault](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nexusdev/dapp-a-day-18-erc20-token-vault)
        * [Authentication (RBAC)](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nikolai/dapp-a-day-4-access-control-via-auth)
        * [...several more...](https://github.com/dapphub/dappsys)
    * provides building blocks for the [MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc) or [The TAO](https://ryepdx.github.io/the-tao/)
    * should be consulted before creating own, untested, solutions
    * usage is described in [Dapp-a-day 1-10](https://steemit.com/@nikolai) and [Dapp-a-day 11-25](https://steemit.com/@nexusdev)
* [ConsenSys: Smart Contract Best Practices](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices)
    * crucial information on security aspects of Smart Contract Development with Solidity
* [OpenZeppelin: An open framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.](http://zeppelin-solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
    * Similar to Dappsys, more integrated into Truffle framework
    * [Blog about Best Practices with Security Audits](https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog)
